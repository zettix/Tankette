Important:
Subclass model/rocket/explosion/other model stuff in javascript.
I hate to keep writing managers.  Just modelmanager with other data.

Expland Collision detection:
  1) rockets/tanks
  2) rockets/rockets
  3) tanks/tanks
  4) more models: explosions.

Collision categories:
Collisions between object are obvious, I guess I need a matrix.

 MATRIX      | missile      | tank         | static model |
-------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
missile      | explosion    | explosion    +  explosion   +
tank         | explosion    | bump         +  bump        +
static model | explosion    | bump         +  nothing     +

I want destructible and indestructible parts of the landscape.
So I need targets.  Let's make a house 

Explosion plan:
  0) Base on rocket1opt as a simple model.
  1) Create explosion as shell in blender.
  1.1) Texture, export texture.
  2) Load static explosion in viewer.
  3) Add player key explosions.
  4) Lifetime them, they are cosmetic more or less.
  5) Test of spherical hitbox.


Network:
  Change json object "x: #.##" to JsonArrayBuilder, possible fewer bytes for native format, double is 8 bytes.  "zr:-9.32" is 8 bytes also.
Experimenting with explosions.  obj[i] and opb.a can fail silently in javascript!


A rocket is about 400 bytes...
(8 dots xyz, and 1 pos xyz, 1 rot xyz = 30 numbers.  times 8 = 240 bytes.
if we could dumb down to 4 bytes, then we get 120 bytes/rocket.  and really
without the dots, down to 48 bytes.
