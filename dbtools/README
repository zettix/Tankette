dbtools: Directory containing files for the creation of terrain databases
for use by Tankette.

The terrain database is in sqlite3 and has 3 tables:
manifest, terrain, and textures
manifest has a single file, called manifest, with two integers, x and y.
terrain and textures each contain x * y files.

To generate a terrain database, run one of the make scripts.
